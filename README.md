# DrawToFile
A program that reads commands from a file and displays a picture on another file.
The user can input a 1 (up) or 2 (down) indicating if the "pen" (the file poninter) is up or down followed by a comma and a space.
A N, S, E, or W to indiciate which way the "pen" should move.
And the user can decide wether or not to include the last two statements a P or B.
P is for print and it prints the drawing so far to the console
B is for bold. If this is included the "pen" doesn't draw it's usual * to the file instead it draws a #.
